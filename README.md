# datasciencehackathonBankEvie

This was my project for a hackathon that focuses on the usage of Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

The data was found from : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#  
Bank Evie is a well established bank who is recently experiencing a decline in their revenue and managed to trace 
the source towards loan defaults. More people canâ€™t afford to pay and consequently causing the bank to suffer the loses. 

Aim of the project is to:
1. Determine the common traits among these loan defaulters using Pandas & Numpy
2. Build a model to predict the future defaulters based on their traits using Machine Learning

It shares the insights from the analysis and next steps.

I used 4 different ML models to find the highest accuracy: Linear Regressions, SVM, Bayes and Stacked(Mixed)
